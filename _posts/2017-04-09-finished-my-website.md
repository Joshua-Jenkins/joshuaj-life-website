# Hello Everyone!

I haven't written a blog post in a long time, and I decided to work a little on my website that I changed from joshuaclayjenkins.com to joshuaj.life. My last website expired and I decided to change my domain name to the new one.

I plan on finishing this site soon, by adding some social media and fixing my contact form, which I know is not working right now.

I will be adding more projects to my site once I finish them and put them in production. I started The Advanced Beginner Challenge! by Dain Miller.
I have listening to his podcast and YouTube videos, and I think he has some really good ideas to becoming a web developer. Here is the link to the course if anyone is interested. It's a challenge through e-mail each day. [Link Here](https://www.advancedbeginnerchallenge.com "Link Here").

If you want to see his youtube video about this course he put together:

When I signed up, I decided to became my journey in JavaScript & React. Right now I am reading through tutorials about the subject, which I am learning a lot just be reading.. Right now I am focusing on Vue.js and going to go into some REACT later on for tutorials.

Thank you for reading, and hopefully see you soon when I upload some projects..
