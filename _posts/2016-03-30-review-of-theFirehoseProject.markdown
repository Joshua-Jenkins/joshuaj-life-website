## Final Project created
![Image alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/finalproject-fire.png "image title")
Created with only HTML and CSS....



<p>This is going to be my review of The Firehose Project during my free two week intro to the course. When starting out, in the course, you learn the fundamental coding of HTML/CSS, which you make a splash page by only using HTML and CSS. After that you go into learning Ruby, which this is getting you ready for preparation for the Firehose Core program.</p>

<p>The first thing you do is start out by making a simple HTML site without any CSS. Once you created it, you have to e-mail it to get it looked at. I received a e-mail back from Ben Ricker, which was only a few hours after I submitted that e-mail. I was really impressed on how fast I received feedback from them.</p>


<p>The second section is to finish up the splash page with HTML and CSS. After creating the page, which they show you step by step how to do it, which I basically knew this stuff in HTML, CSS from different courses that I have taken about it. The main challenge they want to see if you could upload that file on a server. I was just going to load it on my server that I have for my website, but I decided to challenge myself and upload it to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages.</a>. GitHub is something that I have not worked a whole lot with, and as being a new developer I need to start uploading my code into for every one to see and help me grow. The best way I learned how to upload a file into the GitHub Pages was going to
the pages GitHub website and following along with MicrowaveSam at YouTube.</p>

<p>This really was my first time working with the command line on my pc. I used my mac command line a lot more, which there isn't that much difference between the two. He was using the Windows PowerShell, which was an interesting thing to learn about. I learned that git was not installed on my pc and I had to get that installed. I went to the Git website and learned how to install that.
There was a major process just to get my page uploaded to the GitHub server. Here is the site I finally was able to upload too. GitHub Pages. I know it is just basic but it's a start.<p>
<p> Next I will be reviewing what I learned in Ruby with the The FirehoseProjects. The Ruby section of the prep course was very informative. I have worked with Ruby a little bit through Udemy and the course was "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" by Rob Percival. He is a very good teacher in my opinion. I talked about him during my first post about learning web development complete course. I haven't really went through the Ruby course just yet because I have been focusing on HTML, CSS and JavaScript more.</p>

<p>The last challenge Problem you have to solve is the FooBar Problem in Ruby. This one I thought was a very interesting problem to solve in Ruby. When I was taking my Intro to Python class, I learned how to do the Fizz Buzz problem, which basically is the same thing as FooBar. This really did help me understand the problem better. I will be using the GitHub a lot in the coming months, just check out my GitHub Page for my projects.</p>

<p>I did get officially accepted in to the Full Program, which is awesome but at this time could not accepted it.</p>
