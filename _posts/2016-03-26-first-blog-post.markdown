<h1>My First Blog Post about Me</h1>
Hello Everyone,
My name is Joshua Jenkins and I decided to start blogging because this will help me understand what I learn throughout programming and it helps keep me focus. A little about me, I was born and raised in California but since joining the Army I have traveled a little bit in different states while being stationed there. I have been coding on my own for a while now, which only been online through Udemy and other resources. Going to go through my experiences with different areas that I studied from.
When I first started to learn to code was after I got back from a deployment with the Army, while I was on leave I decided to look into coding for some reason. I just felt like I needed something new for a job in the near future. I do not remember why I chose Udemy, but I decided to buy one of the courses called The Complete Web Developer Course-Build 14 Websites by Rob Percival. When I started that course, I was amazed how much detail was put into that course and learning basic HTML and CSS was the stepping stone for me. The best part of that course was getting unlimited web hosting for one year (worth $199) for free, which that helped me build my first website. I just had to buy a domain name, which I brought joshwebdevelopment.com for my practice. What I think the best thing about Udemy is that they do sales all the time, which I brought a few different courses also for a good price. That course was the where I believed that I could become a web developer in my future. He just made another course with some updated things, which I got, but haven’t really messed around with it. Here is the link to the first course that I took Udemy.

I decided to change my major from the college that I was going to from business management to Information Technology because this is what I wanted to do with my life after the Military. I still have a long ways to go before I get my bachelors, but I am working my way there. I just about to finish my first web development class, which was intro to programming that we focus mainly on Python. I have learn so much about Python and how interesting that coding language is. My main issue right now is staying focus and staying on track on learning one thing at a time. I have been jumping around too much on what to learn, I go from basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript than I work on Ruby just for a little bit. I am hoping this blog thing will help me keep on track and learn things in order.

Right now I got news that I might have to leave the Military sooner than I thought, which makes me have to think what I am going to do after without a degree just yet. I have really been focusing on joining a coding boot camp, but looking at the cost of those has been my down fall.  I really do wish I could do a boot camp that in class room setting but I just can’t right now. There is a place in Austin TX that has a good program but I just can’t afford that one right now. I really do wish in the near future my GI bill could be used for coding boot camps in my area besides the one in Colorado.  I do think it would be a good investment for service members to be able to use there GI bill for coding camps.

This is getting kind of long for my first blog, but I do hope I get better at writing blogs in the near future. Right now I signed up for the free two weeks at The Firehose Projects, which I am working on their pre-work course. I will be writing a review and my progress through out that program. I hope you come back to read that review once it comes around.
