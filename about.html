<p>How did I get into coding in the first place? Well that’s a good question, which it all started with my son wanting to learn to code games. He wanted to become a game programmer, which I decided to consider finding him some resources to help him out. I started it off with Udemy course that was learn to code by making games by Ben Tristem. This course was amazing and opened my eyes into what world of Coding. I learned that making games was not what I was not my style, but from there I started to consider web development. I found another course by Ben Tristem, which was The Complete Web Developer course. This course was just amazing and it even had a discount code for web hosting for FREE with the paid course.
</p>

<p>I have played around with all types of frameworks and coding languages. I am passionately all about code now, and I decided to learn everything.  I hope to one day get a job doing web development in Austin TX. I believe that since being in the Military, I can become a great programmer because of the skills learned in the Military.
</p>

<p>Right now, I am focusing more on JavaScript, which I am going to learn the MEAN Stack as much as I can, which is big in my area. THANK YOU for reading this long story, which I look forward to talking to you about opportunity’s that come my way.
